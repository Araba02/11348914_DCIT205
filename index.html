          <p>
            This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
            Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
            society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
            Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
            science involves the study and development of applications that
            allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that
            support these applications, and the means and methods used to
            produce both applications and systems that behave reliably,
            correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the
            skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer
            Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current
            techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering
            principles to the development, construction and maintenance of
            computer programs.
